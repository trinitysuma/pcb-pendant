# pcb-pendant
module 1 of creative embedded systems

This assignment uses the KiCAD files in the 555timerCES folder. 

Modify the PCB layout and traces to your desire. Adhere to the placement indicated in the schematic. All traces are made on the F_Cu layer. 
To change the shape of your board, upload an SVG to the Edge_Cuts layer.

Follow the directions in pcb_to_easel to convert the KiCAD files into SVGs. My files are in the SVG folder and are used to mill the board. 

Follow the schematics in the 555timerCES folder to correctly place and solder all components.
